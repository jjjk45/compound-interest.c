This is a small personal project I'm doing before taking Systems Programming this Spring to refresh my C skills.
Using lots of Google, stack overflow, and AI to learn best practices in C. Like using the out parameter.
It feels good to know I'm learning really fast but also feels bad to know that I could get a very similar end product with a couple prompts.
